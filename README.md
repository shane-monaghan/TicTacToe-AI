# Tic-Tac-Toe Versus AI
This project contains the files for a Tic-Tac-Toe game I made that allows the user to play against the computer.
I completed this project for fun in my free time using Python and Pygame as a way for me to learn something new by applying my skills 
in a way that I had not done previously and for me to take a first step of sorts into the realm of AI.
I implemented a minimax algorithm to create the opponent AI and I used various Pygame features to create the user interface.

# What I Learned
Overall, I found that I learned a good deal from this project despite the fact that it may have been relatively simple. First, 
I had only ever worked with binary tree structures before for the most part, so having the opportunity to see and use a general tree 
structure was nice. To complete this project, specifically implementing the minimax algorithm, I also had to do some research into game theory 
and AI. I found learning about those things to be extremely interesting. Finally, this project taught me a lot about adapting. 
My original plan for this project was to simply make a tic-tac-toe game against an AI that the user could play in the console, so that
was exactly what I did. After showing the project to a friend, however, they suggested that I create a user interface. Seeing as this
was not something that I was originally planning to do, there was some code that needed to be adjusted to fit this new addition.
This proved to be a valuable experience because most projects I have completed previously had clearly laid out requirements from the start, and
as a result, I have not had to adjust existing code on the fly very often. In the end, I'm very glad that I did end up adding a user interface
element to the project because it provided me with an opportunity to learn how to adjust existing code and to practice using Pygame which was something I had already been wanting to do more with.
